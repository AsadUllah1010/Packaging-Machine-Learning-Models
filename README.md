# Packaging-Machine-Learning-Models
In these codes we will package a model in an API using postman. 
# Introduction
Model packaging is an essential step in the Machine Learning deployment process, where the trained model is prepared in a format that can be easily deployed and integrated into production environments. Packaging Machine Learning models involves saving it and wrapping it with an API. Hereâ€™s the process of packaging a Machine Learning model:

Step 1: Export/Save the Trained Model
Step 2: Writing a Wrapper Function to Load the Model
Step 3: Setting Up an API to Serve the Model
# Features
Iris Dataset
# Usage 
Please download the desktop version of Postman on your system. And follow these steps to test your API:

Open Postman and create a new POST request.
Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict (Replace the URL with your URL).
In the Body tab, choose raw and set the data type to JSON.
# Conclusion
So, this is how we can package Machine Learning models in the form of APIs. Model packaging is an essential step in the machine learning deployment process, where the trained model is prepared in a format that can be easily deployed and integrated into production environments.
